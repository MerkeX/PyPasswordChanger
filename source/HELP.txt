This tool allows you to generate new passwords for all your websites account.
#
- OPTION 1:
#
With the option (1) you insert the site name and your user name one by one
(Boring and time consuming if you have a lot of passwords to change).
#
- OPTION 2:
#
With the option (2), you will need to have the exported file containing all of
stored password (You can obtain it from 'passwords.google.com' or, if you're
using Google Chrome, by typing "chrome://settings/passwords" in the address bar);
Nonetheless, you have the possibility to actually encrypt your password, using a simple
'Caesar Cipher', so you can write down your passwords without worrying about some one
getting his hands on your them.
#
- OPTION 3:
#
Same as (2), but this time you use a previous file created with this tool, instead
one exported.
